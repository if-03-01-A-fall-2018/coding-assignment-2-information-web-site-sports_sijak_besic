          You need a well-developed circulation to the heart and lungs to give you the ability to keep going without gasping for breath.
          With stamina you have a slower more powerful heartbeat and will be able to cope more easily with prolonged or heavy exercise. </p>
          <p class="nextP">
          You need well toned muscles to give you the ability to do physical work.
          When your shoulder, trunk and thigh muscles are toned-up they will work well and you will not experience strains and injuries as often. </p>
          <p class="nextP">
          Developing good mobility in your neck, spine and joints will prevent you spraining ligaments and pulling muscles and tendons.
          You will also be less likely to experience aches and pains from stiff joints. </p>
